# Day 6: Launch EC2 Instance

## 🎯 Objective
To launch an Amazon EC2 instance with the required configuration for compute workloads.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
- Navigated to EC2 Dashboard
- Clicked on Launch Instance
- Selected an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
- Chose an instance type based on workload needs
- Selected an existing key pair for SSH access
- Associated an existing security group
- Configured storage options
- Reviewed and launched the EC2 instance

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- EC2 instances require an AMI, instance type, key pair, and security group
- Instance type selection impacts cost and performance
- Security groups and key pairs are mandatory for secure access

## 📌 Real-World Use Case
EC2 instances are used to host applications, run backend services, perform data processing, and support scalable cloud workloads.

## ✅ Status
