## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Gain **hands-on AWS experience** through daily tasks
- Understand **real-world cloud and DevOps workflows**
- Build an **interview-ready cloud portfolio**
- Practice **incremental cloud infrastructure management**
- Develop confidence in **AWS core services**

This project follows a **learning-by-doing** approach rather than theoretical study.
